### What is JS?

### DataTypes in JS

There are 2 types of Datatypes

1.  `Primitive data types, also known as build-in data types` => DT which are fixed and hold single value like number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol. A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, primitives and immutable.

2.  `Non-Primitive data types, also known as reference data types` => Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects. Non-primitive means storing multiple values in single variable. non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter. they are mutable.

### Operators & Conditional Statements - Used to perform some operation on data

`Comments in Js` - Part of code which is not executed

Ex :-
// Single line Comment
/_ Multiline Comment _/

`Arithmatic Operators` =>
+, -, \*, /
Modulus = %
Exponentiation = ^

` Unary Operators`
Increment = ++
`a++` = post increment (change value in next line)

`++a` = pre increment (firstly chnage value then print)

Decrement = --
`a--` = post decrement (change value in next line)

`--a` = pre decrement (firstly chnage value then print)

`Assignment Operators` => (assign value)
=, +=, -=, \*=, %=, \*\*=

`Comparison Operators` => (Compare two values)
==, ===, !=, !==, >, >=, <, <=
`==` equal to
`===` equal to and type
`!=` not equal to
`!==` not equal to & type

`Logical  Operators` =>
`&&` Logical AND
`||` Logicl OR  
 `!` Logical Not

1.  `&&` Logical AND
    T && T = T
    T && F = F
    F && T = F
    F && F = F

2.  `||` Logicl OR
    T && T = T
    T && F = T
    F && T = T
    F && F = F

3) `!` Logical Not
   True = false
   false = true

### Conditional Statements - To implement some condition in the code

`syntax` - it means rules

1. if Statement -
   syntax -
   if(condition){

   }

2. if-else Statement - (if condition true execute if block otherwise execute else block)

   if(condition){

   } else {

   }

3. else-if Statement - (used for multiple condition)

   if(condition){

   } else-if {

   } else {

   }

`Ternary Operators or Conditional operator or Special Operator` => (worked on 3 operands, simpler if-else )
condition ? true : false
a ? b : c

`switch Statement` => (The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses, and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.)

switch (expression) {
case caseExpression1:
statements
case caseExpression2:
statements
// â€¦
case caseExpressionN:
statements
default:
statements
}

### Loops in JS -

     Loops are used to execute a piece of code again & again

1. `For Loop`
   for (initial value; stopping condition; increment/decrement){
   for loop body
   }

2. `while Loop` - 1) we cannt write semicolon and the end of loop.
   while (stopping condition ){
   // do some work
   // updation
   }

3. `do-while Loop` - 1) it will exucute atleast once , because we will write our condition after the do condtion. 2) we will write semicolon at the end of loop.
   do {

   } while(condition);

4. `for-of Loop` - used to iterate string & arrays, it will ieterate each values of arrays and string.

   for (variable of iterable)
   statement

for (let val of strval) {
// do some work
}

5. `for-in Loop` - it is used to iterate the object. it will return keys.
   for (let key in objVar){
   //do some work
   }

### Strings

String is a sequence of characters used to represent text

`Create String`

      let str = "I Love Javascript";

` String Length`

      str.length

` String Indices`

      str[0], str[1]

### Template literals in Js

A way to have embedded expressions in strings.

Ex. `this is a template literals`

`String interpolation`
To create strings by doing substitution of placeholders.

`string text ${expression} string text`

`escape characters` - Basically used for adding text in new line

1.  \n = next line
2.  \t = tab

### STRING METHODS

1.  These are build-in functions to manipulate a string.
2.  String methods does not change original string it will log new strings.
3.  Strings are immutable.

String Methods. 
1.  `str.toUpperCase()` // convert string into upper case.
   
2.  `str.toLowerCase()` // convert string into lower case.
   
3.  `str.trim()` // removes whitespace.
   
4.  `str.slice(start, end?)` //return part of string, end value should be optional. `(start, endindex - 1)`.
   
5.  `str1.concat(str2)` // join str2 with str1, it will return new string, we also concat multiple strings.
   
6.  `str.replace(searchValue, newValue)` // used for searching value in string, replace newValue with searchValue. It will only replace first seachvalu , if duplicate character are available

            `ex -
            let str2 = "Hello";
            console.log(str2.replace('l' , 's'));
            `.

7.  `str.chartAt(idx)` //search character at particular .
